The bestial power as suffered for your god

Crucified, killed, buried
Sacrificed messiah
Kneeled down, blood stained

The Christians, today they still cry
But the bastards adore images
Remembrances from the past, from the crucifixion
Rotting Christ, nailed to cross

From the semen of the mankind
We'll spread our seed

The truth, painful truth

Death and destruction will still reign"

Even in the deep of Hell
Fallen corpse, fallen angel
Total injury is the only rule

Death, slaughter, death rules
Under the sign of fear we live
Bestial lust, bestial rites
Darkness send its bestial warriors
Shrill cries, tormenting cries
Break the silence of the dark night
Living with hate, living with death
Giving the world total destruction

Blood world, rotting world

The radiation corrodes our faces 
Over mutilated corpses we have to march 
Destructed empires, where's God now? 
That calls himself the redeemer of the mankind 

Infernal visions torment our minds 
Pools of blood spread through the world 
Christians cry in torment 
Asking for help to their redeemer 

War!

The black sunset breaks out the silence 
The last scream of pain is heard 
Death burns its victims 
Sending their souls to hell 
Feel the blade in your sacrifice 
Now it's the time to abjure gods 
The black war comes with the wind 
There is neither heaven nor hell, but only war 

Massacring the ones
Mutilating the fools 
The black death empire 
Exterminating without mercy

Until we see the ashes of pain

Crucifixion

We'll show to the world our hate
The priests will have their final torment
We'll spit on the churches, we have an ideal
Black tortures you'll feel
The mankind goes to suicide
They have faith in gods as false as their name
Christ, preacher of goodness and beauty
Gods, preachers of lies and destruction

The god's grave doors
Is below his brains
Rottenness and dirtiness go out
By a simple prayer of mercy
The reason of his death will be your blame

The dead, they already celebrate his arrival
In the altar of fallen gods, throne of his own existence"

Killing is what he wants
Too false and fools
He there is to torture

Gods of the storm
Infernal death

Gushes on my hands
Show me the wrath

On the frozen lands
He is born
Living among the barbarian
Violence is his business
He's forget his sword
On the fire of Pandemonium

The sky turns as black as spell
Haunting my eyes and my mind
Funeral rites

You are chosen by Hell

Graves will be violated
And corpses will be stolen

Illusions of darkness
Power of death
Strength of hell
Empire of the damned

On the Black Hills of Megiddo you'll find
A place so cold as the mist, so dark as the night
Black armies marching to the hills
To make the power of the reign of darkness grow

The exterminating angel
He's there's to be emperor
To command Nospheratus
Creature of crypts
Die

From the eternal darkness
A blade will shine
Saints and Gods will judged
Killed and buried

One day this empire will be discovered
For the judgement of mankind
Gnash of teeth and endless cries will be heard

You feel a pain that burns your flesh
Your reflection inside the mirror
Shows a past soiled by the blood of innocents
The human greed will be their own destruction
The apes in their cages surrounded by thorns
That are forcing us to live here

I feel an urge to melt and go through cracks
To vanish like a fossil that will be found
Flying on the universe
Brains of armed lives hidden in pits
It's a fight of dwarves strengthening the giants
They are sons of the same father, fruit of the same mother
All of them cry together in despair

But what's heard is only the buzz of flies
Over the rotten flesh
There's no more safe ground to be on
Everybody around you reflects an image
Distorted and wounded
I can hear the cry of a million souls
That have been already marked by their deaths
While the laughs of satisfaction echo endlessly...

Insanity - lacerating the last sanity
Endlessly - still remains on minds
Lunacy - masses smashed by a holy shit
No regret - from the past comes the storms

The sky throws up storms trying to avenge itself
You feel a pain that burns your flesh

A cry for mercy trapped in my throat
But even in hell, there's a place for cowards

The burning sun over my head
The troop is comin', compassion I dismiss
Sentence of death pounding on my back
There's no hiding when you're thrown against the wall

""To Paradise,"" the priest is saying, blessing my death
He's standing in front of me, his merciful sight sickens me
He says that soon I'll have my judgement
I'll kneel down in front of the Lord

And he asks me to regret my sins, but it's too late
Growling words from the bible, raising my agony
Oh God! How I'd like to have my hands untied

The wall I'm facing now
Seeing my life going through my eyes
Feeling death behind my back
An acrid taste of defeat tormenting my last years
And when I feel my body being punched, smashed
There's no pain, just silence
My last breath echoing, spreading through the air
My body in pieces, a stream of blood

Bloody drops whipping the wall
The silent wall that has understood my silence
The silence that was a prisoner of my soul
Is my soul that now is the ruler of the world

Blood, pain - nothing to say
Why then must we die?

Escape to the void
Escape to the void

I look at my face on the other side of the mirror
My face falls down in pieces full of worms
I burst my rotten heart with my own hands
I'm dying and I can't help myself

Blood, pain - nothing to say
Why then must we die?

What have I been running from?
I'm not guilty
You've shown me the worst way
'Cause you're my victim, the next one

25,sepultura,Schizophrenia,Screams Behind The Shadows,"Death comes from the unknown
Darkened by its own existence
The end no longer exists when the spirit leaves the body
Phenomenon that mankind would rather forget

Shadows and cries
Are found together trapped inside the world
Hateful was your life in the past
To torment someone is your present destiny

I feel pleasure seeing your agony
It bursts my insane subconscious
From life I took nothin' but insults
From death I got irrational pleasure

Is it possible to feel satisfied after death?
Yeah, life has marked you with despair and takedown
Death welcomes you as a seed lost in oblivion
As a bastard son the world has rejected

Life betrays you on each step
On each body that faces you

On each soul that meets you
On each tomb that is closed"

To be born again, it'll be a sad destiny
To seek death when it's inside of myself

To feel scared
But beyond that, to wish being at an end
Clotted blood
Mass mutilation
Hope for the future is only Utopia

Blame and lies, contradictions arise

Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self

I won't change my way 
It has to be this way
I live my life for myself
Forget your filthy ways

Blame and lies, contradictions arise
Blame and lies, contradictions arise

Nobody will change my way 
Life betrays, but I keep going
There's no light, but there's hope
Crushing oppression, I win

Betraying and playing dirty, you think you'll win
But someday you'll fall, and I'll be waiting
Laughs of an insane man, you'll hear
Personality is my weapon against your envy

Walking these dirty streets 
With hate in my mind
Feeling the scorn of the world
I won't follow your rules

Nonconformity in my inner self
Only I guide my inner self"
35,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Stronger Than Hate,"I shall redeem myself from
The clutches that grasp at my inner self
No tomorrow will ease my oppression
My streak of hate leads my way

Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate

I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between

Look at me
My feelings turn
Stronger than hate

I can't decide on which way to turn
My choices are few and far between

A lifetime of remorse
There's no place that I've never been

Go

I stand above the remains
My vengeance I have regained
I don't know what lies on the floor
I won't be locked anymore

Standing here, I've lost all faith
I have no social equality
To live again would be a lie
My life is not worth the pain"
36,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Mass Hypnosis,"Looking inside, your future uncertain

Uncertain of being back
They make you feel so good
Everything's darkened
Obey like a fool

Hate through the arteries
Mass hypnosis

Soldiers going nowhere
Believers kneeling over their sins
Inhuman instinct of cowardly leaders
Make the world go their own way

Tens of thousands hypnotized
Trying to find a reason why
Look inside your empty eyes
Obey till the end

Looking inside, your future uncertain
The fear grows as a sickness uncured
The silence agonizes, the words sound strong
Look inside the eyes, leave this world

Hate through the arteries

Soldiers going nowhere
Soldiers blinded by their faith"
37,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Sarcastic Existence,"Humidity could be felt on the walls
Touched with the palm and used to scare
They used to sweat, they used to stink
Everything swamped and hot

But in the corner, laying on a bed
A cold piece, made to stay alive
Trapped within its body
It could not think anymore

Thoughts of times of sanity
The world was isolated
Where the sun would salute him
And the night was violent

Fear and guilt
Invade the corners of the room
Pain was felt constantly
They keep on destroying

It could be seen through the window
The eye of disgust and scorn
When you hear the laugh of a madman
That's about to die

To suffer alone in disgrace
His hate is his own
Always hating being alive
Sarcastic existence"
38,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Slaves Of Pain,"All of us are victims
Confined by enigmas
Without solution
Your frozen thoughts don't let you evolve
A prisoner of your own trap
Slaves of an infinite pain
What will be the limit?
What will be the end?

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain

Seeking new paths
Don't be tied to your mistakes
Run away from this
Uncured sickness
Open your eyes
Don't lose your steps
Liberty is a dream
And it is also real

To die, to run away
To forget what I've been
To erase my past
To kill my guilt

Life ends
Feeling death
Slaves of pain"
39,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Lobotomy,"I've seen you fighting through the time
I've followed your steps, full of pain
Unnamed hero that's challenged the human ego
Victim of cowardice

Of strong manipulation
A system that was made to lie and to deceive
Screams of agony
Satisfy the proud

But these screams still echo inside the conscience
Contradiction, aggression, desolation, illusion
Nonconformity takes my mind
Too much injustice to forget so fast

My disgust is greater than my compassion
Feel the pain upon my final hour
Self-blame can't hurt me
Eye for an eye

You receive your just reward
Now I'll live my life with indifference
I've tortured without remorse
I've slaughtered without fear

Brain killing brain
Brain killing brain
Brain killing brain"
40,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Hungry,"Rotting skinny corpses left alone
They're like an endless disease
Invisible, painful, eternal
Creatures fucked by a greedy past

Since you were born
You want to make money and power
A simple fuel to the corrupt
Way of mankind

Hungry for living, to live like a slave
Without knowing your master
You have no value, you're just another one
Death will quench your hunger

Hunger for confidence
To shake the hand of your best friend
And later to be betrayed
The law rules the mind of ignorance

Hungry for pleasure
You act like a robot
The tears in your eyes
As red as blood

Your pleasure is pain
Your pleasure is torture
Hunger is your pleasure
Hungry for the future"
41,sepultura,Beneath the Remains,Primitive Future,"I follow the steps in front of me
They are deep and well-defined
They show an undefined but straight path
What has been will never return

Future won't let me look back
I just walk, I don't evolve, I just walk
Animals run by my side
They communicate, each one in its own way
But I can't understand
I feel alone on this irrational planet
To create or just observe
I keep walking on this desert made of ideas
Primitive future

My head is heavy but empty
Everything around me is void
Without movement, without perspective
The night invades the sky
That darkness, the dry ground
Makes shadow join the big stain that's forming
Steps on skulls of generations
And harbored eyes

I hear painful cries of wars that are to come
To create everything again, from the beginning
To teach new minds
To awake a sleeping giant buried
On the ashes of disgrace

It's sinful the way I live
I look well, I think I'm well
That's all...

I follow the steps I see in front of me
They are deep and well-defined
They show an undefined but straight path
What has gone through me will never return
Primitive future"

Where these two armies
Have clashed and met

The sacred earth without a face
Consumed by murderous sinners

Guilt and frustration

I rob you and slaughter you, your downfall is my gain
And still you play the sycophant and revel in my pain

And over two hundred armed forces

And opened fire on the inmates

Cannot control the brutality of its police

Holocaust, body piles
Confrontation, mutilation

Discipline, ignorance
Conflagration, torture

Over eighty percent of the inmates were not sentenced yet
The bodies were filled with bullets
And bites from the police dogs

There are old folk battered in the open street

There are eyes that see but say nothing at all
There are ears that hear but they don't recall

Who has won?
Who has died?

Bodies packed on minefields
Neurotic game of life and death

Who has died?
Everything happened so quickly.
I felt I was about to leave hell
I'll fight for myself, for you, but so what?

To feel scared
But beyond that, to wish being at an end
Clotted blood
Mass mutilation
Hope for the future is only utopia
Mortality, insanity, fatality

We are buried in the spewed trash for ourselves

Blood, pain - nothing to say
Why then - must we die?

Escape to the void
Escape to the void

I look at my face on the other side of the mirror
My face falls down in pieces full of worms
I burst my rotten heart with my own hands
I'm dying and I can't help myself

Blood, pain - nothing to say
Why then - must we die?

What have I been running from?
I'm not guilty
You've shown me the worst way
'Cause you're my victim... the next one

The pest in the eyes of death follows us

It begins to eat inside us, decaying our bones

English translation by OmegaRed/David Ache

he despair, the pain, the fear 
Decisive factors that make you think 
The wine and blood, the flesh and bread 
Wounds that do not heal that intrigue your life 
Heaven and hell, the cross and the forgiveness 
The light in the end of the tunnel and life after death 
You've made your decision 
Don't wait for trial (judgement?), there's no hope for your soul
(literal translation: ""Don't wait for trial, your soul is lost"")

Pray - Pray - Pray - Pray 

Heresy, Curse 
The father, the son, and the Holy Ghost 
They ignore the faithful that don't stop praying
(literal translation: ""They ignore the faithful that don't get tired of praying"") 
They scream, sing the prayer 
I'm sorry, but they won't listen to you 

Pray - Pray - Pray - Pray 

Regret, sinners 
The penitence purifies 
The blood drips 
The pain fascinates 
Only fear makes you pray 

The war is sacred, the sin is mortal 
The Host that tastes like esfiha 
Torture, fire, inquisition 
The violent past of the Church is normal 
Armaggedon, destruction 
The end of the world is not much to fuck your life 
To enrich, to resuscitate 
In the name of Jesus don't start crying"

Live for the sound loud to survive
My will has no bounds to keep this alive
Truth paves the way to the world that I know
Love for our brothers we'll not fail to show
Learn what we hear, see what we feel
The air that I breathe could not be more real
Spit out bitter pill that made me want to hide

Time is your enemy only if you let it be

Os animais?A força da natureza? Não!
É o aprisionamento da liberdade de expressão

Se o carrasco do poder degola a nossa cultura?

Ahhh você não se importa com o destino do mundo
És corajoso demais, então por que temes diante do caixão?
Seu melhor amigo evita a Sepultura
Sua certa e última morada

Temes a batalha do Armagedon, a ira do Oligatan
O Apocalipse final, mas por que esse temor
Se pasaste por todos os prazeres terrenos
Os sete pecados capitais e todas as aberraçžes sexuais

143,sepultura,Revolusongs EP,Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos,"I got a letter from the government
The other day
I opened and read it
It said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me given' a damn I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself
Because they never did
I wasn't wit' it but just that very minute...
It occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell
How long has it been?
They got me sittin' in the state pen
I gotta get out - but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun - to be another one
Public enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all
To criticize me some crime - never the less
They could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel

They got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'
Tellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'
4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well
The same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell
You have to realize - what it's a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust - yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
And I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked - I never clock it y'all
'Cause time and time again time
They got me servin' to those and to them
I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a C-O
Sleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'm tell you the deal
I got nothin' to lose
'Cause I'm goin' for the steel

You know I caught a C-O
Fallin' asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so
And everyman's got served
Along with the time they served
Decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent -
Because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like with Oliver's neck
I had to get off - my boys had the feds in check
They couldn't do nothin'
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This is what it takes for peace
So I just took the piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out
6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for the rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinkin' like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right
Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious - call me delirious
But I'm still a captive
I gotta rap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand
Now I'm lookin' for the fence

I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers
Bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Goin' out with a bang
Ready to bang out
But power from the sky
And from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose - yes
And some came close
Figure I trigger my steel
Stand and hold my post
This is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine
If I come out alive and then they won't - come clean
And then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up
Blew up, who shot...
What, who, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just gotaway
The joint broke, from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone"

The more we seek and find
We are what we can reach
We are the ones alive

It's all according to plan
To survive the best that we can
Where is it we're all trying to go
We can't escape as it is

Take what there is accept as it is
Take what is yours accept as it is"

Do you walk with fear

Just drunk with power

Lost cause
No coming back
Lost soul
There's no regret
Lost cause
No coming back
No thrust, Mindwar

A war of words
Battle's in your mind
Contradictions rising
What's wrong and right

Lost cause
There's no regret
Lost soul
No coming back

I know you've heard it all
It's no excuse for what's been done
You know you felt the pain
When you sat and watched there suffering

We've got sick people in this fucked up world
It's just ripping away at everything that I feel
Even the sight of you makes me ill

Wondering if it's ever going to end
Your bored all the time with the things that you do
I don't pity your life

I see your acting all weird
It all seems so clear
Your making no sense in a world so immense
Stop wasting my time

Always judging a face
What the fuck is wrong with you
Sucking out the life of anyone that you can reach
A mind so sick

Blood sucking leech
Life taking leech
Blood...

Life wasting leech

Blood sucking leech

Mankind is not completely absurd
Breaking men ground to build and to grow
Advancing their lives for better or worse

In a world growing fast we're losing touch
Cultivating hate and forging rules
Closing our eyes we search the sky
Expectations are from religion

What went wrong
I don't believe you

It's been around for thousands of years at least
There's nothing new with another catastrophe
A sense to move on is filling the air

What went wrong
I don't believe you
What went wrong
I don't believe you

Men is not alone in this world and
Mankind is not completely absurd
Breaking men ground to build and to grow

Kashmir - Colombia - Rio - New York
Old wars revived to revenge a lost
Taking what's left and burning it down
Creating opposition

What went wrong
I don't believe you
What went wrong
I don't believe you"

To fall beneath your heavy grasp a plan to have control
You keep yourself locked within a cage an agonizing hell
I won't let you bring me down not this way again

Acting as a victim in a twisted little world
Dealing with your problems I just don't seem to relate
The pressure is more then I can handle I feel I'm going to break
I won't go through this shit again not this shit again

Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away
Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away

Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away
Walk away
Don't come again
Walk just walk away"
159,sepultura,Roorback,Activist,"Our pulse to resist
Moves our cultural resistance
I'm living this life
Inside a civil tribe demised
Improve my old mind
Breaking all rules absorbing what I may find

Our manner to protect
Destroys what's left for protection
Believing in symbols
The church will fool our souls
Prove you my role
Acting against undesired control

Don't fear your left
Don't trust your right
Activist

Our way of seeing progress
Making us walk towards repression
Disturbing our peace
In the name of self defense
Being felt by all
Our violent taste for the humans fall

Don't fear your left
Don't trust your right

161,sepultura,Roorback,Bullet The Blue Sky,"In the howlin' wind
Comes a stingin' rain
See it drivin' nails
Into the souls on the tree of pain.

From the firefly
A red orange glow
See the face of fear
Runnin' scared in the valley below.

Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue.

In the locust wind
Comes a rattle and hum.
Jacob wrestled the angel
And the angel was overcome.

You plant a demon seed
You raise a flower of fire.
We see them burnin' crosses
See the flames, higher and higher.

Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue
Bullet the blue.

Suit and tie comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills
(Slappin' 'em down)
One hundred, two hundred.

And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the tin huts as children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street.
Up the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes into his saxophone
And through the walls you hear the city groan.
Outside, is America
Outside, is America
America.

See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound
Howlin' the women and children
Who run into the arms
Of America."

We'd like to thank everybody for coming out here tonight
You know, we have a little story I want to tell here
About how my day went
Started off with some complications
But you know, everyday's filled with complications
But people just have to deal with it
But my complication... its something that's been bothering me now
Maybe I should tell y'all about it
Sounds something like this...

Woke up this morning
Got out of bed
Went to the street now
Hanging your head
Walk into the practice
And be hanging out
Getting ready to tear some music
Gonna rock it all out

Paulo's microphone

We started to start jamming
Started rocking out (vc tą gravando essa porra?)
The music started flowing
It started coming all out (Filha da Puta)
Only one big problem baby
The microphone was broke
Couldn't record that music
The songs had blown the 'phone

Paulo's microphone
You know it could be...
Paulo's microphone

He told me that shit was Sony
That shit could never break
But we lost all the music
Around a quarter to eight (Filha da Puta)
And now we just keep flowing
We won't let it stop
You know it's gonna happen
With Paulo's microphone

Paulo's microphone
This shit is broke again

Three beast blocked the path
That lead the way to my life

The beast from the uk
The beast from the us
The un beast was then unleashed
To solve the problems in the world, but they don't!

Despise their false prophecies

The crowd of souls in sudden flight 
Hoping for prayers in the world 
Late repentant - no stain from hell, no stain from hell

I thought the worst had, I thought the worst had past 
Traitors of the people, they have no face
I will not trust what I can not see 
None will have the time to strike a blow - the final blow, the final blow

Hell - no stain from hell 
Those fools are the ones we vote for 
The kings and rules of negligence 
Taking a nation to lead in decay 
A shade announcing another law 
Can not believe I couldn't escape 
No chance to leave this plague 
I have to be cleansed, from all the blame 
The final blow!"

Listening to everything spoken to me
No there is a chance that you were just using me
Innocents turned to see your way of life
Its ripping through me everyday
My head keep spinning with the shit that you said
You even had me get down on my knees
Praying for something that I never believed

Your words are dead, I buried them, there dead

Living with promises that couldn't be kept,
But I wasn't convinced
Many things you didn't want me to see,
Now I'm standing in disbelief
Different voices speaking of you
Planting darkness in the hearts of men,
You never thought it would come back again

Your words, are dead. I buried them, there dead

Your not the king of the world
You let your ego get the best of you
Your not the king of my world"

Another missile speech, as they preach with no leash
Seven nations threatening the world with a bomb
Sevens sins creating a world from the whomb

Show me a way, I can live and I'll grow
There is a way, that we can learn for ourselves

Written in your eyes the answer is ill
The anger builds a fire within
Every lie the system is stained
A minefield of egos, opinions and words... no more

Show me the way, I can change, I'll grow
Show me a road, where I can reach, where I can reach the light
Light at the end of the road

In this new world, painted black
Sloth and pride and envious anger
In this world, another mark
Excess and lust with arrogance
In this new world, without a past
Atomic shit to fuck with our heads
In this new world, that's full of crack
Our children cry, they're lost and mad
We're lost!
Show me the way - I need to know - Show me the road"

That sits there deep down inside
Walking in bullshit,
Nothing seems quite right

I want redemption!

Standing still, open doors
Feeling pain, can not move
Feeling scared, standing still
Better start something,
Better then nothing,
Can't go on seeing,
All of these horrors

Eyes wide open can't keep them shut,
From this horror of the shame
Can feel the pain, life's fucked up,
When we witness our horrors
Real close up

Better start something,
Better then nothing

Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
And then you're pushed and shoved
Into every corner
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter

As the sweat is running down your neck
All you're praying for is to stop you
Body breaking up
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load

Don't try to reason, can't hardly wait

I can't be the enemy of myself
Everyone gets knocked down
At some point in life
But it's how you deal with it to get back up

I can't live without nothing
Must have guidance and focus
Cast out all the suffering
Hope thrives only when active

219,sepultura,The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart,Impending Doom,"Crawling through ages in search of dignity
Stained with the backlash of filth we call humanity

Brother, brother, brother, what have we done?
Brother, brother, brother, what have we done?

Draining the life force of anything within our grasp
Selfless needs and dirty deeds
We leave nothing to chance at all

Mother, mother, mother, what have we done?
Father, father, father, what have we done?

Creating a wasteland, we sink slowly awaiting death
Born to suffer, live to kill, our motto of all mankind

Brother, brother, brother, what have we done?
Brother, brother, brother, what have we done?"
220,sepultura,The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart,Manipulation Of Tragedy,"Strength
The power behind the words
They block the instinct
My head
They have an interest
Learn, obey, but not to think

Worship, worship, bow down
Worship, worship, bow down

Why?
There's something that keeps us in check
It contradicts a big part of life
It's self-inflicted
Manipulated my God, the box

Worship, worship, bow down
Worship, worship, bow down

Seeking to create destruction
Whoever stands in the way

A force to deal with it
One and all will fall beneath
There's no good reason for ourselves
Death is calling out

All out
Ripping apart
All out

All out
All is dark
All out

Fate is lashing out
Forgiving all your sins
Released unto all
Let the healing begin

God, save me now
A fury is breaking free
A force to be dealt with
One and all will fall

Many run to look for shelter, and realize it can't exist
It has only one mission
To wipe all that's in the way

It's a tsunami

All out
Ripping apart
All out

All is dark

To live in darkness
We slip, we fall, stand by it all
Sick of the filth, our world decay

Lost our way, we fell from grace
Fell from grace, we lost our way
Stronger, fearless, changing it over
No more silence, push our way

You didn't make us
In the end we'll save us
The bliss is gone, you awake to see
Our choice to be, brought back belief

We live our time, must wake and find
The facts all sides, our freedom now

Our freedom, now"

Scars left and wide open

And what are you looking for, needs to be believed
It needs to exist in your head
You need to believe to disbelief
What do you believe
Depends on the idea planted in your mind
What type of seeds have been planted?
What do you believe depends on what you see

Diversions are blocking our vision from the truth
The clear reality
Diversions turn our world to shit must stop. Deny
No gods, no leaders, no prophets telling my future
No heaven, no hell, not a messiah

The needle of our medicine injecting poison vaccines
Our veins no longer carry blood, robotized, I deny
No news, no adds, no anchor telling us lies
No secrets, no war, there's no savior

It's the age of the atheist

All your senses
Eyes wide open

It's the age of the atheist"
225,sepultura,The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart,Obsessed,"I can't stop the fear that's killing
No denying, hope is dying
Living in hell
Fear that's killing, no denying, hope is dying
Living in hell

Want that, need that, I must have that
Hunger endless, restless spirit

Once you taste the pain of sorrow
No tomorrow, doom upon us
Living in hell
Once you live it, no forgiveness, rotting sickness
Living in hell

Sleepless nights, inviting terror
Impending doom of death and horror

First it starts in the brain
Heavy thoughts that haunt me everyday
A mental trip of helplessness
I can't help but believe I was born obsessed

Obsessed, obsessed
Obsessed, obsessed

Fear that's killing, no denying, hope is dying
Living in hell
Fear that's killing, no denying, hope is dying
Living in hell

There's no future but an end
Hopeless pounding is always deep inside my head
Unwilling to change, it's just insane
Lost in dark I fall paralysed

Obsessed, obsessed
Obsessed, obsessed

It sneaks its way to haunt reality
All seems hopeless over valued ideas
Unwilling to change
Drifting further into the eternal darkness"

Da lama ao caos, do caos a lama
Um homem roubado nunca se engana
Da lama ao caos, do caos a lama
Um homem roubado nunca se engana
O sol queimou, queimou a lama do rio
Eu ví um Chié andando devagar
E um aratu pra lá e pra cá
E um carangueijo andando pro sul
Saiu do mangue, virou gabiru
Oh Josué eu nunca ví tamanha desgraça
Quanto mais miséria tem, mais urubu ameaça
Peguei o balaio, fui na feira roubar tomate e cebola
Ia passando uma véia, pegou a minha cenoura
Aí minha véia, deixa a cenoura aquí
Com a barriga vazia não consigo dormir
E com o bucho mais cheio comecei a pensar
Que eu me organizando posso desorganizar
Que eu desorganizando posso me organizar

Da lama ao caos
Do caos à lama

Such a big catastrophe but I had deal with the struggle
It all began passing life so easily
Ready for almost anything, but it took a different direction

Then, one night, sharp turns. A light came from no where

Blown away. Never felt my injuries
Bleeding deep inside of me
Just knew I had to help all those people

Lost. My mind it's gone. That life
Lost. I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there

Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my Phantom Self

It's a mystery. Changed my body's chemistry
Always creeping up on me
Wiped out my whole soul of existence

The crash. Flash backs. Carnage the blood keeps on flowing
Killing me. Trapped inside this tragedy
Can't see the road in front of me
Replay this nightmare over and over

Lost. I've been looking for myself
It haunts me everyday
I'm searching for a truth no longer there

Transformed I'm someone else
Must face my Phantom Self
Transformed I'm someone else
I'll face my Phantom Self"

A story was told by profiteer's lies
Rewriting our past and the truth

I was made to believe. Television a story on screen
All made through deceit by the corporate elite
The fear controlling our minds

Raise your hands and reach for your God
Created to fight and kill in this war
In the end I'm fighting myself

Loud and clear. From far and beyond
No bullshit from teachers and leaders will change
What's real inside of my head

My voice. Loud and clear

Do you believe in justice for all
Or obey unlawful and ruled
Left. Right. All: A con

Rigged the game from the start
Don't play me for a fool

My voice. Loud and clear

Do you believe in justice for all
Or choose to be callous and cruel
Left. Right. It's all a con

Won't play me for a fool

My choice. Blood in my eyes

Promoting a lfe made of stereotypes
Sickens me down to the core

Forced to face
With who we are and what we did

No deception
Or promises
Everyone is running out of patience

The writing's on the wall
The tide is turning, now
Won't pledge allegiance, why
Our goals will never die

Constrained by corruption
Bleeding hearts were lead astray
Swore an oath
To lead the way
But the greed transformed to shame

There's a reason to break these chains
We're all aware
That no one wants to live this way

Locked up and confined
No attention
But we stand
We stand to make a difference

Killed by the stress

Just have to let go

Broke all the rules of the game
I tried to make it all end
Of course you will have to pay
Live life toiled and fray

Hard-wired to life day after day
There's not a difference it all seems the same
Triggered frustration from feeling this way
Social destruction

Anger raging. Silent violence
Torture unfolds. Silent violence

It started as nothing but grew into something
Just feeding away until you cannot function
You're never controlling but in disillusion
It's grinding away like a modern day plague

Don't blindfold your eyes,
So loneliness becomes the law
Of a senseless life

The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
To get there... (Go!)

Now you have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay
- For how long?
Cold is the wind and thunder struck
On a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on!

Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
There's so much hidden behind
As so much more we've gotta give...

Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
In a cage of conclusions crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head

Running over the tears you've contained
Now cover up your eyes

Over here is the ship of your life
So rotten that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby all the night
And if you get lost you can hold my hand...

And I'll be here when fire burns

Climb up the hills and mountains,
Don't forget what you've learned!

Life makes us feel the time we cannot hold
Time makes us live a tale already told
Time makes us heal a feeling inside
A feeling that lies in our heart
That we stole away...

Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
And there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is telling the truth
To live in the crowd
Sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal
Calling you back for attack

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
To cry and feel the pain...
In the morning
You stagger up
To start the fight
You get so lonely...
With no fore-sight
Until another day!

Run, don't wait the sun,
'Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows, they still stand...
Until the end!

Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
To cry and feel the pain...

Run, don't wait the sun,
'Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows, they still stand...
Until the end!

Don't let your pride
Make your blood flow in vain
Until the end..."
249,angra,Angels Cry,Lasting Child,"Part I - The Parting Words

Years gone by - Awake again
In a glowing star - That shines so far
Lasting child - Remains inside
Playing around - A future denied

High overhead, dusk is insight

Fumbling the mist
Lingering around...

Blow,
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond...

And then
A painted dream
Colours that melt
Inside slender frames
There I'll stand
There I belong...

251,angra,Holy Land,Nothing To Say,"Long ago, the same sky above;
""It's lonesome when the sun goes down""
A day had come when we were like one:
- Weapons up, never surrender! 

Oh, I saw the gleams of gold
We'd kill and die conquering a virgin world
The hold corrupted by the honour 

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back to my place, I've got
Nothing to say! 

Guilt and shame, it's all so insane
Pagan gods die with no defence
And we could go no further at all
Digging the graves of our conscience 

Oh, the sounds, they still echoe
All of us drifting on seas of blood
The hope hidden behind the horror 

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back from this land, I've got
Nothing to say!

Living forevermore, leaving today
For all what remains I've got
Nothing to say! 

Oh, how many years have gone
Every morning I bare myself from love
The love rising up from the sorrow

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back from this land, I've got
Nothing to say!

Living forevermore, leaving today
For all what remains I've got
Nothing to say! 

Living forevermore - Nothing to say!
Back to my place, I've got

Living forevermore - Nothing to say!
For all what remains, I've got
Nothing to say!"
252,angra,Holy Land,Silence And Distance,"Been here for so long
On the morrow I'll dare
Silent and distant
Reaching out, unaware
Stealing the whispers
From my deepest request

And you watch me
Waiting for something new
My hands, as empty
As my body and soul
Could keep pretending
But in the heart I'd be gone...

Still stare at my face
But lost seem your eyes
Keep hold of the sails
Against the blue sky

Ooh, I'm intending
A way back to the sea
This emptiness burns inside
And leads on for endless miles

Don't let me go
Away across the sea,
It may be much more wide
Than what it seems to be

Ooh, I'm still searching
The way back to be freed
The loneliness hangs around us
However we can't see

Now let me go
Away across the sea,
The waves can't be as high
As they pretend to be

And now I know
In my heart, I won't forget
The sails against the blue sky
That taught me how to live

... With no sorrow
And tomorrow we'll share
Silence and distance
Till our faults are repaired
You'll be the mistress
Who I'll never forget."
253,angra,Holy Land,Carolina IV,"Salve, salve Iemanjá,
Salve Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água

Jogam flores para o mar
Deus salve a rainha
E o meu passo nessa esfera

All I see floats with the wind
All the miracles of the water
Are the miracles never seen

Salve, salve Iemanjá,
Salve Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água

Somehow my life now begins
This music that's been played through time
Now starts to reach my feet

Jogam flores para o mar
Deus salve a rainha
E o meu passo nessa esfera

Feels like the flood of my needs
From the harmony of forever
Sound the melodies of the sea

Um caboclo de orixás
Logo deixa a terra
Vai de encontro à sua sina

And you will know on the way
I'm coming back to my enemies
I'm turning around, I'll be
Just coming back to my last days
I'm coming back to the sea!

Onde o céu encontra o mar
Achará seu porto
E é assim que isso termina

So... why won't you come with me, my friend?
Thrills... like we had before
Hope... never showing up the same
For a lonely man

Salve, salve Iemanjá,
Salve Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água

Jogam flores para o mar
Deus salve a rainha
E o meu passo nessa esfera

Since the day we left the land
We've been anxious on aproach
Captain kept showing his plans:
""Under sail we go!""

Deep the ocean's blue I stare
The reflections of my soul
We have with us a special guest
And for him we made a toast

Carolina IV took a river to the sky
Seven men on board taking part
To take their hearts around
All around, around the world!

All I can recall that day
On that very day for sure
All hands up against the haze
As we attempted the return

Carolina IV took the river to the sky
One man less on board - human dreams
Have sometimes cost their lives,
All their lives dreaming

I've been such a fool
I've been so afraid
From my heart to you I say:
- I'll be here to stay!

Nothing much left from the boat
Many years have been and gone
Still I can't forget the past
And the ones I left at home

Carolina IV took the river to the sky
Windy whistling nights
Made me sail right into the wind's eye
Now I'll die singing:

I've been such a fool
I've been so afraid
From my heart to you I say:
- I'll be here to stay!

I've been such a fool
I've been so afraid
From my heart to you I say:
- I'll be here to stay!

Salve, salve Iemanjá,
Salve Janaína
E tudo o que se fez n'água

All I see floats with the wind

Jogam flores para o mar
Deus salve a rainha

254,angra,Holy Land,Holy Land,"We were born in a Golden Age
Beyond the creed
Blown with the winds to meet
The ones who creep
And pray
Unshold feet traces on fresh sand
A map unfold
Spreading out knowledge,
Magic and love
And then

... Ooh, and then,

Carried by wooden gods
We leave toward the sky
Gushed out the holy blood
From those who die
To bless

Ooh, and dance...
Ooh, still dance...

Someone has sent
Somebody here
To bring an age
Long disappeared

Holy Land - Throw your scars on me!
My soul just tends to be
Your friend

Holy Land - Holy Land around
Holy Land - Holy Land is all...

Someone has sent
Somebody here
To bring an age
Long disappeared

'Cause I'm still here to see
Your face

255,angra,Holy Land,The Shaman,"Oh boys, I've seen the old man;
Straw mask around the forehead
The blaze, a blast and the awakening dead
(The magic seeds will spread...)

The bleeding warrior, he has fought
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place till the dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Serpent skin, a savage scream, don't you believe, it grows and grows...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warn up the soul
While the body is freezin'!...
- I swear it!

Against the men for the land,
Against the beast to survive
Against the demons to keep the faith
(The spirits and the fate...)

A word - together they will shout!
(Run and pray if you're afraid you better stay away from it all!)
A rumble shakes up all the ground
(Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right now!...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!

A word - together they will shout!
(Healing leaves, piranha teeth, nobody leaves this place till the dawn!)
Against the passion, for the love
(Start to sing, to turn and spin, get rid of all your sins right now!...)

Oh boys, it's all so easy:
Warm up the soul
While the body is freezin'!
Still we can hope a single word together;
Warm up the soul...

- Boys, I swear I've been there!"
256,angra,Holy Land,Make Believe,"Sat beside the meadow
Watching weeds grow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul

Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face

I, after all
Just a lonely man - a lonely heart!

Working on the future
Floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades, so

Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted
Maybe I wanna die some other day

Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No, don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
(The whispers of your hope are left behind!)

Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted

And I've tried
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives

Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait till my life is wasted
Maybe I wanna die some other day"
257,angra,Holy Land,Z.I.T.O.,"Somehow I turn around and see
My nerves break down inside
Maybe you might know much more than me
So tell me what is right to say

Down the weakness of my soul
Lie the secrets, and I know
There's something pushing back

Wish my hands could turn to gold
And my heart would break the cold
To give my thoughts some sense

The turn is close, new century
Still people think they're kings
Now you've got your voice, your own speech
Don't wait till someone else agress

Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsabilities
Just feel the sea of bliss

Mother nature brings to me
In fantastic purity
Everything I need

Like a teenager discovery
What's more delightful than this?
Try to remember how good it was
Feeling the life as it is
To believe!

New world was born
Out of man's dreams
Now we walk on our own

The angels cried
You've heard them weep
But now it's time to make them sing!

Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsabilities
Just feel the sea of bliss

Mother nature brings to me
In fantastic purity
Everything I need

Like a teenager discovery
What's more delightful than this?
Try to remember how good it was
Feeling the life as it is
To believe!"
258,angra,Holy Land,Deep Blue,"Three cliffs there stand
High above where high winds howl
Surrounding silence
Three birds climb, then turn to fall

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
Should I always be the same, once again?

Take my hand and follow
Sweeping trees, the coats of green
Time has no place tomorrow
Feel the good in endless dreams

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
Should I close my eyes and pray,
Always be the same, once again?

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
Should I close my eyes and pray,
Feel like I've betrayed,
Always be the same?

Now that I'm waiting for the day when the ocean and the sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
Should I always be the same, once again?"
259,angra,Holy Land,Lullaby For Lucifer,"On the sand, by the sea
I left my heart to shed my grief
A vulture came begging me:
- Feed me with this piece of meat!

I won't give away
Something I need

On a garden nursery
I let my fancy wander free
Children playing around a tree
Sharing apples happily

Come and rest with me
Lay your hands on dreams

I'll wait here by your side
Till you fall asleep
I'll wait until you cry
All over me the tears you hide inside..."
260,angra,Holy Land,Angels Cry,"Cry in the night of angels
For that light that never shine
With their hearts so full of sorrow
Muddy waters all around
The curtain falls for helpless souls
How they suffer swept aside
And the raging streams are flowing
With so little hope inside

(It's like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Capture their fall

Try to see this misery
Your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
In the angry darkened skies
(Angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Oh, see the sun in the sky
(From the dawn of destruction)
Free, free this chain from my heart...
(Chain, chain, chain)
Hear the cry of angels
From this life you cannot hide
The change must come tomorrow
For the solemn weeping eyes

(Like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Captured in the fall

Try to see this misery
Your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
In the angry darkened skies

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
There must be some way
Endless you stray, still you pray for a better life
Nobody sees when a glimpse
Of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims unshined!

261,angra,Holy Land,Chega De Saudade,"Vai minha tristeza
E diz a ela que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece
Que ela regresse, porque eu não posso mais sofrer

Chega de saudade, a realidade é que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza, é só tristeza e a melancolia
Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai

Mas, se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços, os abraços
Hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim
Abraços e beijinhos e carinhos sem ter fim

Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de você longe de mim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de viver assim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio de você longe de mim
Que é pra acabar com esse negócio"

White gold, a morning came
Sunny cold, reflecting light
Unknown songs

Fresh water gush licks the lime
Sprinkling crowns of silence
The face wet from the moistened dew

Wind takes the sight
Around the meadow
Playing kindly

Silver dropped wine
That flows inside
A sleeping hand...

Desperation fills the air
(In your heart lies the dust of the anger)
Madness knocking on my back
(Chiming bells have announced the new day)

My courage lies someplace
Where time forgot to send me
(Now where are you going?)
(Now where are you going now?)
Someday they'll mark your sins
Like torture on your back

I wonder why
My mind is tight
Like stormy weather
And so it seems
That little steps
Would take forever

Oh, never understand...
We're like mad horses
Heading for the bend
This place I'm standing here
Made it on my own
Moored my life to never let it go...

Slavery kings run free again
From their wounds a giant stands
Four hundred years of glory
Animals who speak and cry
Destiny of craving sights
Inside the dance of white domain

Wheels turning round will feed the ground
And women carry by their children with no life
To future days belong the past

But change the times
Now millions cry out
From away it comes...

Freedom overall to last forever

No disgrace
No more separate race
We'll keep together till the end"

Misty memories of a past come by
And I'll write my pray
On your face of hidden secrets
Never shared, freezing soul

Dreams last forever
To the empress of the dark
Lay down on eternity
Your music in the air
Great delight in the symphony

Fear and loneliness in my dreams

And I know I'll never be the same
Living this tragedy insane
All I wanna be is to be free with you, with me
I don't blame the fate but it's still hard to face
The truth

It was all just like paradise
Just like we wanted it to be
Far beyond the reason rest our lives
Eternity denies the guilt of reality senselessness

Two eagles flying to be free
Moments of madness will be left behind
The same horizons but in different lands"

Oh, here they come again

The stars can't find the purple sky

Long for the day be back someday
And the church
(Church is selling consolation, killing Jesus for salvation)
Don't let us die
(Taking all in desperation, leave me now to rest in peace)
Let me rest in peace

Away, a while
Our smile taken from
The hearts of brokens souls

Stand away from the fire
Destined by the fate
Let those sinners pay how they steel
For on the judgement day
How they yield

Stand in front of the whole creation

Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas

Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels

He is the Painkiller

Faster than a lazer bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns

Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured

Returns from Armageddon to the skies

273,angra,Reaching Horizons,Angels Cry,"Cry in the night of angels
For that light that never shine
With their hearts so full of sorrow
Muddy waters all around
The curtain falls for helpless souls
How they suffer swept aside
And the raging streams are flowing
With so little hope inside

(It's like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Capture their fall

Try to see this misery
Your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
In the angry darkened skies
(Angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Oh, see the sun in the sky
(From the dawn of destruction)
Free, free this chain from my heart...
(Chain, chain, chain)
Hear the cry of angels
From this life you cannot hide
The change must come tomorrow
For the solemn weeping eyes

(Like)
Angels crying
Can't take no more
Angels dying
Captured in the fall

Try to see this misery
Your future is not what you wished it to be
So try to fly, the answer lies
In the angry darkened skies
(Angry darkened skies)

You just keep on standing in these fields all your life
You sow the seeds that never grow
No harvest comes such a strain to feed the few
Still you're waiting, it's in vain...
The change must come right now!

Angels are crying and dying
There must be some way
Endless you stray, still you pray for a better life
Nobody sees when a glimpse
Of your target lies behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims unshined!

274,angra,Reaching Horizons,Time,"This time I wanna know what life means...
... To live it again
I'm looking forward, feel the light shine in my eyes
And now I know, my instincts were not wrong
And many things can be done
I don't believe now
That I'm dreaming alone

Oh, we're searching for the love
That everyone's got, but can't see
Oh, beyond the flesh and blood
There's so much hidden behind
As so much more we've gotta give...

Sanity brings up the sadness
That keeps your illusions locked in a little box
Fright comes, you find yourself lonely
In a cage of conclusions crowding your mind
You sit back bowing your head
Every answer - yes
Why don't you trust me and shed out your fears,
Running over the tears you've contained
Now cover up your eyes
- Is it good for you?

I will be here when fire burns!

Welcome on board
Over here is the ship of your life
So rotten that will cast away
I'll be your sweet lullaby all the night
And if you get lost you can hold my hand...

And I'll be here when fire burns
(Inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
Don't forget what you've learned!

Life makes us feel the time we cannot hold
Time makes us live a tale already told
Time makes us heal a feeling inside
A feeling that lies in our heart
That we stole away...

And I'll be here when fire burns
(Inside your heart)
Climb up the hills and mountains,
Don't forget what you've learned!

Life makes us feel (life makes us feel)
The time we cannot hold
Time makes us live (time makes us live)
A tale already told
Time makes us heal (time makes us heal)
A feeling inside
A feeling that lies in our heart
That we stole away...

In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have fore-seen...

Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
And there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is telling the truth
To live in the crowd
Sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal
Calling you back for attack

Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
To cry and feel the pain...
In the morning
You stagger up
To start the fight
You get so lonely...
With no fore-sight
Until another day!

Run, don't wait the sun,
'Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows, they still stand...
Until the end!

All I wanna be is to be free with you, with me
I don't blame the fate but it's still hard to face
The truth

It was all just like paradise
Just like we wanted it to be

Eternity denies the guilt of reality senselessness

Two eagles flying to be free
Moments of madness will be left behind
The same horizons but in different lands"

Into the light I'm running

Climbing the highest peaks of pain
A reason to stay

Can't stand the pressure pot
The Bibles that I've bought
They told me I'd be free someday

Maybe I'll just forget
And someway won't expect
This anger shadowing my nights

Into a nightmare falling
Somebody keeps me on high
Staring with kindness, no domain
A reason to stay

To stick together on the ropes
Why don't you get out my way, I've gotta go!

""It's lonesome when the sun goes down""
A day had come when we were like one:
- Weapons up, never surrender! 

Oh, I saw the gleams of gold
We'd kill and die conquering a virgin world
The hold corrupted by the honour 

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back to my place, I've got
Nothing to say! 

Guilt and shame, it's all so insane
Pagan gods die with no defence
And we could go no further at all
Digging the graves of our conscience 

Oh, the sounds, they still echoe
All of us drifting on seas of blood
The hope hidden behind the horror 

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back from this land, I've got
Nothing to say!

Living forevermore, leaving today
For all what remains I've got
Nothing to say! 

Oh, how many years have gone
Every morning I bare myself from love
The love rising up from the sorrow

Living forevermore, leaving today
Back from this land, I've got
Nothing to say!

Living forevermore, leaving today
For all what remains I've got
Nothing to say! 

Living forevermore - Nothing to say!
Back to my place, I've got

Living forevermore - Nothing to say!
For all what remains, I've got
Nothing to say!"
282,angra,Holy Live,Z.I.T.O.,"Somehow I turn around and see
My nerves break down inside
Maybe you might know much more than me
So tell me what is right to say

Down the weakness of my soul
Lie the secrets, and I know
There's something pushing back

Wish my hands could turn to gold
And my heart would break the cold
To give my thoughts some sense

The turn is close, new century
Still people think they're kings
Now you've got your voice, your own speech
Don't wait till someone else agress

Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsabilities
Just feel the sea of bliss

Mother nature brings to me
In fantastic purity
Everything I need

Like a teenager discovery
What's more delightful than this?
Try to remember how good it was
Feeling the life as it is
To believe!

New world was born
Out of man's dreams
Now we walk on our own

The angels cried
You've heard them weep
But now it's time to make them sing!

Swimming naked of beliefs
And responsabilities

All the miracles of the water
Are the miracles never seen
Somehow my life now begins
This music that's been played through time
Now starts to reach my feet
Feels like the flood of my needs
From the harmony of forever
Sound the melodies of the sea
And you will know on the way
I'm coming back to my enemies
I'm turning around I'll be
Just coming back to my last days
I'm coming back to the sea!

So... why won't you come with me, my friend?
Thrills... like we had before
Hope... never showing up the same
For a lonely man

Since the day we left the land
We've been anxious on aproach
Captain kept showing his plans:
""Under sail we go!""

Deep the ocean's blue I stare
The reflections of my soul
We have with us a special guest
And for him we made a toast

Carolina IV took a river to the sky
Seven men on board taking part
To take their hearts around
All around, around the world!

All I can recall that day
On that very day for sure
All hands up against the haze
As we attempted the return

Carolina IV took the river to the sky
One man less on board - human dreams
Have sometimes cost their lives,
All their lives dreaming

I've been such a fool, I've been so afraid
From my heart to you I say: I'll be here to stay!

Nothing much left from the boat
Many years have been and gone
Still I can't forget the past
And the ones I left at home

Carolina IV took the river to the sky
Windy whistling nights
Made me sail right into the wind's eye
Now I'll die singing"

Into the abyss of a bygone time
Lest we forget what really matters
And the bewildered look up to the sky

Fallen comrades lay on the ground
Victors in death they make no sound

Petrify my eyes
Behold the sights of battle lost
In this unchanging world
What does the poor life of a warrior cost?

Oh can't you see
Many faces from God's own races are waiting to fight the good fight
Even thought the annals of time have passed you by you still don't see
Oh, you won't see

When will this torture end
Into the mire, to battle again"

Somewhere else away from home
An angel's kiss, the fresh breeze on her face
Closed her eyes and walked into the haze
And fade away

Taken by promises

From the fire
Burning herself and her soul

Fade away, fade away
Scenes from yesterday seem so far away
'Til the day they'll return again

Taken by promises
She's just begun to feel the heat

Burning herself and her soul

So understand, my friend
Sometimes there's rain
Sometimes there's breeze
Fanning the fire, and so

Burns herself back to dust
Brings the hope and the love
Sews the end of the rope
Gets us further somehow

Away from home and from all
Thoughts dancing out of control
Turning the stones into gold
Leading to planets unknown

That things are gonna change
New boundaries on the way
Like never were before

All over now, all the pain and awful lies
Angels will arise
Back to life!

Fresh winds of hope
Has taken us ahead
Forever is a place
You have to keep in mind
No way to limit our goals
We'll find a reason to believe
Facing Nova Era

Bring the sunrise again!

New day shines, fallen angels will arise

Nova Era bring the angels back to life... Life!"

Till it vanishes away

Like candles in the darkness
We fight against the wind
Devotion to your idols
Soon will overthrow the king

Out of order
Taming borders
Tearing down the fences 
On and on and after all
The century has gone
Racism jumble
Turbulence
My eyes believe we have gone to the end

Ordinary Earth
Sailing throught the space

Population alienation
Losing all affection
Calling on to heaven's hope
To watch for my protection
Out of luck
Potential stuck
Remote controlled
By the T.V. again

Carries human souls
Lead us the journey of our fate
So come millennium sun
Won't you show us the way
Future's begun
So words from my mouth come
Whispering for your return

Pictures a sunset on the lake
Mirrors of crystal your portrait
Walking on this field while I wait

So come millennium sun
Won't you show us the way
Future's begun
So words come from my mouth
Whispering for your return
Show us the future's began

The jail on quiet nights

Mankind will soon learn
That the end has come in time

Dividing lands, retracing

Revealing ages when the absence
Of forgiveness rules our lives

Home how I go
My badge is wearing out
Written on the sand
Words to reconcile - unholy wars

Forgive us our father
For we have sinned
Blinded by pride
We know not what we do
Thy kingdom will be done
By holy wars

The battle is over
But the war still rages on!

Living in despair

Out on your own in the dark
Sinners meet the saints
Bloody river overflows
You don't really care

Setting on fire
Your own freedom
Played the hardest game
Now you will burn
Your eternal flame

Even the brave won't deny
Evil warns again
And your conscience ins't safe
Driving you insane

Playing with fire
Put your freedom
Through the hardest test
Don't blame the scare
On your final day

One last minute passes by your soul
Just one minute more in the horizon
You will face the judgement day
(Scream your voice free to the air)
Waiting for the judgement day

One last minute passes by your soul
Just one minute more in the horizon
One more minute passes by your eyes

We all face the judgement day"

And follow you through the day
You shot the doors but I'm right behind
Where shadows remain

I promise I'll still be there
To say I promisse
I'll still be there

Life was short for the romance
Like a rose it will fade away
I'm leaving everything

No regrets, war is over
The return of a soldier
Put my hands on my bleeding heart
I'm leaving all behind, no longer waiting

You tear into pieces my heart
Before you leave with no repentance
I cried to you, my tears turn into blood
I'm ready to surrender
You say that I take it too hard
And all I ask is comprehension
Bring back to you a piece of my broken heart
I'm ready to surrender

Free your mind and spirit)

Mother Earth, do you part take my
Soul, oh no!
Water, wind and fire...
Will take our spirits away

(Victims of Sacrifice)
Face the Angel of Death
(Struggling to survive)
Soon your time will be over
(Revolution remains)
Your salvation is ahead
It's not so sad
There is no pain for the dead

There'll be no rest till you're dead

Liberation of soul
It's not so sad
There is no pain for the dead, oh!

323,angra,Temple of Shadows,Winds Of Destination,"Blood is flowing on the ground
Like a river branching red lines
Anguish is all around
Hope yielding to despair

Life is a circumstance
Any minute slips away
God, please look upon us all
Do you give a damn?

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles giving
Pleasure to my eyes
Sadden my delight
When the joy is over laying scattered
On the ground

Oh! The sun will rise
The beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies
On the Winds of Destination
Carry us away...

Secret ark of Solomon
Hidden in the temple wreck...
For the king
Many years and centuries
Till seven knights from the order

Down the tunnels of the past
Learning from the undisclosed...
All the way!
Holding dreams on zealous hands
All those archives
Lost and wasted
Somewhere in the battle fields

Farewell to common world
Templars are watching
And guarding the scrolls
Shields of faith the knights behold
All Manuscripts of the sacred
Laws are there

Dancing in the air
Spinning leaves in circles
Giving pleasure to my eyes

...Arise!

Oh! The sun will rise
The beginning of creation
Oh! Into the skies
On the Winds of Destination
Carry us away

Old leaves will be falling
Old trees will remain
Whirlwind carries you away
For tomorrow be the same"

From the first day to the last
Several things we had to learn
Countless mistakes from times of yore

Now we restart, we recreate
Your present is your fate

Don't turn your backs on mankind!
Only yourselves you wanna save
Ignorance burns just like a fire
Consuming people on its flame

Fellow creatures, so wonderful!
So different and so grand

Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds for the future
Were scattered yesterday
Tomorrow's harvest field we plant
Today
Your crown will ever last
The tall trees of life

(Life experience)
Break your shell reach the light!
(Mind and sould)
Find your path to the skies
(Will come around on a thunder sound)
Raging with power and fury the new
Born world

Sprouts of time
The roots evolving
The seeds from the past
Branching out
Growing forever

Hands on heart
Embrace each other
The dances, the faces, the smiles
Behind the past

New seasons bring the chance
To start again
Tall trees will ever last
The circles of life"

On the shadows of your eyes

Counting what was left from the
Illusions in my mind
Hopeless fights
Foolish thoughts we were in heaven till we die, oh!
Death will bring us back where we belong
Now you must decide before the
Dawn is brightening up the day
Announcing in the sky the Morning Star

Nothing left to lose
I am going on my way tonight
(On my way and...)
Shouting to the moon
I'll be roaming till I find the Morning Star - Oh!
Another chance you waste
I'm the owner of my days
I'll be howling through the night till the end of time.

Look out!

All this time I was lost in the desert
Got to get away!
Now I must decide before the
Dawn is brightening up the day
Announcing in the sky the Morning Star!

Nothing left to lose
I am going on my way tonight

Silent like the moon
I will wonder till I find the Morning Star - Oh no!
Another chance you waste

To find yourself lost and lonely
Were so foolish
You were selfish
Much too blind to realize
You messed up your own life...

Eu vou contando os dias
E já, já não tenho medo
Eu lhe peço
Eu imploro
Quando a minha hora chegar
Meu descanso minha paz

Cante uma canção desconhecida
Posioning with hope
The hearts around you
Plante mais lembranças na sua vida
Death is calling you
(Now or never!)
Nada além do amor é o que parece
Please the ones you love
Before you miss'em
Toda a minha dor na minha prece
Win my chances back cause
Life is short but it's never late!

(Tempo que passou)
It's time to find Redemption
(Não vai mais voltar)
Only love defies the Resurection
(Tudo que se foi)
Mark my words: God's abandoned this
World!

Would I live again?
What's the new religion? Yeah!
And what shall be the bread?
Really I don't give a damn!
Never wanna live again
In this vain emotion
Over for me!

Sing a lullaby now I remember
(Tempo que se foi e não se esquece mais)
Memories are twisting in my mind
Win my chances back
Cause life is short but it's never late

(Tempo que passou)
It's time to find Redemption
(Não vai mais voltar)
Only love defies the resurrection
(Tudo que se foi)
Mark my words: God's abandoned this
World!
(Toda a minha dor)
My destiny is over

And this hope above your
Comprehension

Is the love you've been dreaming so
Long
Over for me.

328,angra,Aurora Consurgens,The Course Of Nature,"Across the ages the world has been
Changing, it's drifting in space

The rest of you that still remain
Guarding your memories, now sleep

Running fast you're only
A flash inside the pan

Life will never
Never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way

Spinning around you
Millions of screams
Deafen all your sanity

Fast decay, no delay
Minutes are lost in sublime

Running fast you're only
A flash inside the pan

Life will never
Never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way

All day you feel lonely
Cause you know
The years have gone by
They'll never come again

Life is overrated
But who will ever know

Life will never
Never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way

Life will never
Never be the same
Time runs over
The course of nature's way"
329,angra,Aurora Consurgens,The Voice Commanding You,"War games inside your brain
You got to fight alone
Falling back, your sanity has gone

Why'd you ever think that you could run away from pain?
Sorry man, your tries were all in vain

Wandering 'round like a phantom in the dark
And you're waiting for the night to come
Lunacy attacks and you struggle to hit back
You'll be waiting for the morning sun

I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing - united we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Someday the madness will loose control... Over you

Dreaming on, you can fly in a never-ending story
Where the sun will shine every passing day
Free your mind, let your spirit go free into the night
Let the minutes be gone and fly away

Coming in and out the confusion in your mind
Going crazy as the night moves on
Playing with your head now you're wishing to be dead
And you're praying for the dawn to come

I'm the voice commanding you
Divided we're nothing - united we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Don't let the madness assume control
Over you, over you, over you

I'll be there reminding who you are
All the time with no escape
You look inside the voice is calling you
Take your chances it's never late

I'm the voice commanding you
Laying down the law
Divided we're nothing - united we're breaking the rules
I'm the voice commanding you
Can't make me go away... I'm over you

I will never surrender

I'm commanding you
Laying down the law over you
A border line
That you can't hide
The voice commanding you"

All the time, desperate hiding tears
My life is boring and I count the days
On and on, woe is here to stay

Only if God would show a sign for me
Oh... Only if God could hold my begging hands

This endless torture's building up my rage
Holding on, hide my agony
I'm getting weary just to be alive
All I want is help!

So, you dove into the dark beyond yourself?
Lost your way to find the surface once again
Insomnia will kill all your solemn nights... Oh!
Haunting your despair!

Sorrow made your life a living hell
Lights are fading
Caught inside the black-holed inner-self
Ego painted grey...

Insomnia will hold pleasures in a shell
And your defiant stare!

Sorrow made your life a living hell
Lights are fading
Caught inside the black-holed inner-self
Ego painted grey..."
331,angra,Aurora Consurgens,Breaking Ties,"Into my mind
It all came closer again
Things that we say
Sometimes throw the reason away

And I know I've been less than a man
There's a burning inside me since then

I have cried for you
Lost my pride for you
Now that you are gone
I can see the sun
I have lied to you
I have tried to do
What you want me to
What a perfect day to throw it all away

Feelings disguised
Are now coming to new life
So many tears
That have fallen down through your eyes

I am only the shell of a man
There's a burning inside me since then

I have cried for you
Lost my pride for you
Now that you are gone
I can see the sun
I have lied to you
I have tried to do
What you want me to
It's a perfect day to throw it all
A perfect day to throw it all away

Wasted time, nowhere left to go
Peace of mind is what I find today
Breaking ties from this lies you know
Life has no meaning
When you're out with me
So don't let it go, you'll never know
How many days and nights

I have cried for you
Lost my pride for you
Now that you are gone
I can see the sun
I have lied to you
I have tried to do
What you want me to
It's a perfect day to throw it all away"

Depreciating life when the days are looking bad

Sick of being alive when everyone is vain
Lost your hopes and now you fight against depression

Cause life's hard for everyone just look all around you
So why squander all your power on self-destruction

Too proud to make amends
Your faith, it all depends - hold on tight...
Too scared to be alive?
Salvation suicide calling me!

A long way to hell

My spoiled paradise has met this dead end
'Cause I live my life all on my own with pride

Too proud to make amends
Your faith, it all depends - hold on tight...
Too scared to be alive?
Salvation suicide haunting me!

Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
On my way to hell"
333,angra,Aurora Consurgens,Window To Nowhere,"No doubts!
You're the result of the chances you take
Face the circumstance!

Have you become who you wished to be?
Resigning to what you loved and cared

There's no way out!
Memories will come to remind you some day
How it could have been

Through every door you will step in
Another choice you're stuck between
Don't look back. Just make your way ahead

A window to nowhere
The void in which I stare
Now that I've come so far where do I go from here?

Decision just came in time
A new door is open
You have to go again... decide!

You finally realize
The whole world you're facing
The window of your life... good bye!

A window to nowhere
Wide-eyed in great despair
Now that I've come so far where do I go from here?

Life is drowned in fears
The river of my tears
Please hold my trembling hands before I go insane all again"

Scars won't deny

Alone again
I start to cry

Staring at me
Too blind to see

Open arms
For all I give
For all I take
Inside of your heart
So near so far

I'm just a boy... like you

Oh! Father I pray
For your charity
Wisdom for life
Was all I needed
Was all I wanted
To share with you

You know my heart
Was not disguise
Waiting for you
So stay with me

I'm now a man! You know!

Come! Take a chance
And give it all
No harmful winds
To whisper for

Life is short, you know
We can regret
Healing wounds always help us to redress
And with you I learned to live

Come! Take a chance
And give it all
No harmful winds
To whisper for

Our time is short, you know
Must we still regret?
Healing wounds always make time to redress
And I love you more each day"
335,angra,Aurora Consurgens,Passing By,"Home you go tonight
To break the sound of tears
Life's fading
To keep the world away
Is not enough to ease the pain

Time is passing by...
Time is passing by; I see it in your eyes

Fire burns inside
A light that's caught between
Night and day
Sun's been set to die
The supernova in your mind

Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
They tell me all!
You can't deny
It's in your eyes

Visions disappear
Memories of a dream
Surrender
Give them to the wind
Deny your sorrow, live again

Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
They tell me all

Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes
Time is passing by
I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes

They tell me all!
You can't deny
You know you tell me lies"
336,angra,Aurora Consurgens,Scream Your Heart Out,"Shaken out of liquid dreams you're under
The hellfire-red, insane nightmares
Is coming back inside
Patiently you walk again
Through the lane of a sandman's pain
Inner urge, tough beliefs
Is the way to a land of free

Howling strong
Shouting loud
The fear should be cast out now!

Awoken from a eternal sleep
You're trembling
In deadly black
With painful eyes
Delusion is back inside

Cry for more
To be sure
And find your own real truth

Let your heart out, put your soul in it!
Time to fly away and let your mind go free
No denying what this life should give
From mistakes you learn to forgive

Scream your heart out! Dig your soul in it
Time to fly again and let your mind go free

No denying what this life should give
Building dreams of your hope is the key
Feel the truth of your heart to relief
From your dreams you will learn how to live!"
337,angra,Aurora Consurgens,Abandoned Fate,"Silent talks
In a cold room, lost
Thoughts are gone
I'm alone

Wonder why
Why the faults were mine

Should I promise this?
Day by day
I need you
Hold you

Can't my eyes just tell?

Claim for pain
Was it all in vain?

New sad days to come
Many smiles we've done
Mourning face
In an abandoned fate

My mind is blind
But I still believe
The truth in shadows
Lies ad me

Don't take my freedom
Is all I've got
Can't force my reason
For lovers knot
I'm lonely and lost

Don't mistreat me
Don't dismiss me
In joy and sorrow

Find a meaning
Keep on dreaming
It is so hard to learn

Here I stand
In a castle of sand
Who can help me then?"
338,angra,Aurora Consurgens,Out Of This World,"So now I see
How nice it could be
To rocket through the star
Like a fire bullet through the sky

Beautiful sight
Silent and bizarre
Wonder where you are
Rocket like a bullet through the sky
Circling on orbit through the night

Peace of mind - not so far away
Till I find my way back home
So close to me
Reaching out - to learn how good life is
Living in a world like this
So close to me
Our blue marbles just a grain of sand
And the universe is waiting for us there

Out of this world
Into the darkest night
Hoping that I'm not alone
People are lost on that solid ground
And there's something I want you to know
We are slowly destroying this world
No other planet
Nowhere is better than here
Into the night

Out of this world
Spinning around the night
Seeing the people so small
I see how much we have screwed our lives
And there's something I'm trying to say
There'll be no second chance for our race
Circled horizons
Staring at our lonely world
Into the night
Like a fire bullet through the sky
When I find my way back home"

What's the promise you have made?
Destruction of your pride
And reconstruction of my name

You betrayed me where's your bravery?
Now you face your doom
Your fate will be traced by the spear
That went tearing through

When you hear the winds of revenge

All of the distance and the chains
You put around my damned soul
Right now it's all finished
I'm just building your new world

While you navigate in peace
And glance at lands you will control
Bewitched you cannot see the route
And hell where you will go

When you hear the winds of revenge
You will see the goddess crying
And the boats will sink and now you play my secret game

Arising thunder!
Welcome to me, you fall alone
Stand up and face me in a fight
Drowning in tears deep in the storm
Once again, once again!

Go!

Look Out!

When you hear the winds of revenge
You will see the goddess crying
And the boats will sink and now you play my secret game

Onward to meet my fate
Time's an illusion today
Away from all I know
A frail that is filled with pain
Feeling the lifeless taste ahead
I wish for no more than air

Flashes of clearness cross my eyes
Disclosing power
The tides will hurry my return
Now in the blackness I see light
I will not cower
I contemplate life with helpless faith
Master of my design I am
Awake from darkness

Pages of wisdom turn
Mind over matter reigns
My fear won't lead me astray

I seek the quiet night
Over the crushing waves
I imagine thoughts on golden rays
And days when I'll rise again

Flashes of clearness cross my eyes
Disclosing power
The tides will hurry my return
Now in the blackness I see light
I will not cower
I contemplate life with helpless faith
Master of my design I am
Awake from darkness I am
Awake from darkness

A broken dignity
An upsurge soon to be
Within these books I find my hope
And liberty

Flashes of clearness cross my eyes
Revealing power
The tides will hurry my return
When in the blackness I see light
My soul won't cower
I contemplete life with helpless faith
Staring into a brighter day
I see the fields which once were black
Master of my design I am
Awake from darkness I am

I hear an angel song
It seems to be a call
Eros's chant of love

It took so long
Spirit brought me life
A passion at first sight
Lend thy hand. My heart

Nymphs dance around the isle
A phantom screams and haunt me all the time
Then you come!
Like an angel from the skies
Princess of my dreams.
I wonder why You are gone
Someday you'll return.

Where do you come from?
Faraway? Beyond?
Virgin as a diamond
Precious like a child
Lend thy hand. My heart (repeat x5)

We've got to believe we'll join our lives
Over the vengeance, treason and lies
We can be one
We can restart

Forgive my mistakes

Forgive my mistakes

I've seen all my past (Someday)
A new force come from the source
A new lease of life"

Soaking the earth, kissing the sand
Your feelings seem to overflow
Running in streams, out of control
A wave is on its way
It will collide against your soul
When your fears are all tumbling in disorder
In the ocean of new emotions

In the rage of the waters
Wild surging
Transformations
Moulding our lives
It's the age of the waters
Stirring up the patterns of our minds

So long, it took me to learn
Surging waves can take all your hope
But when the torment ends, comes the calm
There's no reason to despair, no!

In the rage of the waters
Wild surging
Transformations
Moulding our lives
It's the age of the waters
Stirring up the patterns of our minds

In the rage of the waters
Where the tides are turning
Feelings are running
Moulding our lives
It's the age of the waters
Boiling the fears we've kept inside
Changing the direction of mankind"

I'll bring the tempest, I won't even question
I'll be gone in a trip of a toe

Inside your rage
Now I'm trapped again
Cloven pine was my prison for a decade

Groves and standing lakes
Island of dreams where you reside
Spirit of the air
You throw your tricks and spells
And Claim for your freedom once denied
It's no good to watch the skies
Through someone else's eyes

I'm a soul of freedom
Lord of wisdom
A creature of nature
I drag'em to the ocean

And claim for your freedom once denied

Souls consumed with haunting fire
An empty guarantee
A stolen freedom

Take the chance to mend your pride
Been tortured and humbled
Never again

Lost in a maze of sounds
Clarity escapes
The whispers chase you away
Numb and unaware

Hollow, the world where you belong
Lies you have believed for far too long
Laid low, life has come undone
Nothing stays the same, for time is all you own
All you own

Under a cold dead sky
In the sea you'll learn what you must be
Stretch for hell as you seek revenge
Bear the scars of your inhuman rage

Lost in a maze of sounds
Clarity escapes
The whispers chase you away
Numb and unaware

Hollow, the world where you belong
Lies you have believed for far too long
Laid low, life has come undone
Nothing stays the same
For time is all you own
Empty spirit, hollow soul"

Long before you came
You'd have found me here.
And never begged for your help
This old land will be mine once again
And all my sacrifice will be worth the price
And never again I'll be a monster in your eyes

You took my freedom:
And shaped it into your servant.
You taught me your tongue.
Denying me the word.
Lord o'mine for so long.
Now comes the time to regain
My land and Miranda will see
All my sacrifice will be worth the price
And never again I'll be a monster in her eyes

By this isle's sounds in your ears
When I have awaked.
After a long sleep

The clouds I was dreaming
I cry to dream of again...

Lord o'mine for so long.
Now comes the time to regain my land
Now comes the time to regain
My land and Miranda will see
All my sacrifice will be worth the price

Forever I'll say.
My stolen paradise.
Will be worth the price and no longer

I can hear, our sea of sorrow
With no harm with no disgrace
I am planting the seeds of tomorrow

In my circle I will reign
I was left behind betrayed,
Oh yeah!

Dark backward, abyss of time
Right in front of my eyes
Evil nature destroyed my trust
All their scheming will end up as dust

In my circle I will reign
I will rise against my enemies

Now come away to your master
Bring throught the air all your magic

I'll bless and curse you till the end
Set your whole self aflame

Foolish visions in my angry dreams
Bringing vengeance to my shore
Now my wisdom shows a different scene
There is not love for us all.

All this time my mind was in the past
Furious footprints in this sand
Now living has revealed at last
All the weakness of a man

Turbulent tides
All the waters seem so rough
Keep your faith because the calm will return

I've been longing for this tide to turn
Bringing vengeance to my shore
Time has passed and this is what I've learned
There is not love for us all

All this time my mind was in the past
Angry footprints in this sand
Now living has revealed at last
All the weakness of a man"

We were actors, we were spirit
Melted into air
Now I left my spell.

Forgivness I embrace
Heaven send hell away
All my life as a dream with open minds I'll restart.

I was blind and deaf until the day
Of wave became.
I have faith in evil, in his balance of the blame
All this world around I created on my own
And now it's time to free this island and be gone.

All my life, like ashes in my hand
Now forgive me prosper till the end
The magic of storms I'll feel in my heart
Like a blaze.

Time, now it's time
Feels like ashes
All my life
How the stars.

I was blind and deaf until the day
Of wave became
I have faith in evil, in his balance of the blame
All this world around I created on my own
Now it's time to free this island and be gone.

Lay a mercy on my enemy
I'll forgive them even across the sea
We are such a stuff, as dreams are made of
Set me free.

I'll carry on, carry on
Tell me, is my start?
We are such a stuff, as dreams are made of
And I'm gone."
349,angra,Aqua,Lease Of Life,"Where do you come from?
I hear an angel song
It seems to be a call
Eros's chant of love
Take me through the storm

When you came from afar
It took so long
Spirit brought me life
A passion at first sight
Lend thy hand. My heart

Nymphs dance around the isle
A phantom screams and haunt me all the time
Then you come!
Like an angel from the skies
Princess of my dreams.
I wonder why You are gone
Someday you'll return.

Where do you come from?
Faraway? Beyond?
Virgin as a diamond
Precious like a child
Lend thy hand. My heart (repeat x5)

We've got to believe we'll join our lives
Over the vengeance, treason and lies
We can be one
We can restart

Forgive my mistakes
(Time will tell)
Forgive my mistakes
Someday!

Since I arrived on this shore
I've seen all my past (Someday)
A new force come from the source
A new lease of life"
350,angra,Secret Garden,Newborn Me,"There was a point when I was there
Where I didn't want to be
But I was there escaping from
A place I've been before

I was myself, I was in me
And from where I see and feel
I saw a man who was afraid
Of who he wished to be

Nighttime is taking longer
My hope will save me from despair
Dragging me out of hell

Hold on, the miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down, the minute you find love
You're facing the light!

When I think I'm going deep
I'm really going hollow
I can see a newborn me
Emerging from the bottom

The two sides of my brain
Engage into a fight
For the right the left is wrong
And for the left the left is right!

The nightmare is growing stronger
My hope will save me from despair

Hold on, the miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down, the minute you find love
You're facing the light!

Angels are calling out my name
I'm so afraid now
How can I know if I am sane
Or going mad?

Hold on, the miracle of life
Will never be defined
Calm down, the minute you find love
You're facing the light!
You're facing the light!
You're facing the light!"

354,angra,Secret Garden,Synchronicity II,"Another suburban family morning
Grandmother screaming at the wall
We have to shout above the din of our Rice Krispies
We can't hear anything at all

Mother chants her litany of boredom and frustration
But we know all her suicides are fake
Daddy only stares into the distance
There's only so much more that he can take

Many miles away
Something crawls from the slime
At the bottom of a dark
Scottish lake

Another industrial ugly morning
The factory belches filth into the sky
He walks unhindered through the picket lines today
He doesn't think to wonder why

The secretaries pout and preen like cheap tarts in a red light street
But all he ever thinks to do is watch
And every single meeting with his so called superior
Is a humiliating kick in the crotch

Many miles away
Something crawls to the surface
Of a dark Scottish loch

Another working day has ended
Only the rush hour hell to face
Packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes
Contestants in a suicidal race

Daddy grips the wheel and stares alone into the distance
He knows that something somewhere has to break
He sees the family home now looming in his headlights
The pain upstairs that makes his eyeballs ache

Many miles away
There's a shadow on the door
Of a cottage on the shore
Of a dark Scottish lake

Many miles away...
Many miles away...
Many miles away...
Many miles away...
Many miles away..."

Lost in the fallen rain

Seasons pass me by, the everlasting circle,
A wicked plan
Is it the destiny? Was it meant to be?
It will not matter anymore

Please, it's time to break the chains
The past you cannot change
Time to let it go

Things you try to hide, hurting deep inside

Flowing in vain
